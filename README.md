# Structured Programming and Compiler Constructions
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Structured Programming and Compiler Constructions. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. SQL Parser
2. First Follow
3. Macro Processor
4. Three Address Code Generator
5. Two Pass Assembler
